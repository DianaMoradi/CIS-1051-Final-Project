# CIS-1051-Final-Project

We faced a few challenges while working on this project. One of the biggest issues for me was color-coding the blocks. Even though I had the correct code and files, the blocks kept showing up black. It wasn’t until the last minute that I discovered the error and fixed it. Another challenge was adding the different levels. We had to make sure each level felt unique and progressively harder, which took a lot of testing and fine-tuning. Additionally, one of our group members dropped the class during the project, so my teammate Ristia and I had to take on their responsibilities as well. While these obstacles made the process more difficult, we managed to work through them and complete the game. 
On a side note, the game has background music, and I’ve shown it to you in person before. But for some reason, when I’m recording it on Zoom, the music isn’t heard in the recording. I could hear it playing while I was recording, so I’m not sure why it’s not coming through.
