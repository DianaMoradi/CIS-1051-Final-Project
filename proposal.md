# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Breakout: Power-Up Edition

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We’re making an upgraded version of the classic Breakout game with power-ups, lasers, and cooler visuals using Pygame.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We’re building a Breakout game where you control a paddle to break blocks, but with power-ups like bigger paddles, multi-ball, and lasers that can destroy blocks. The game will look better with animated backgrounds, effects when you collect power-ups, and cool visuals for the paddle and ball. We’ll use Pygame to handle all the graphics, physics, and controls, and the game will get harder as you go through levels.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No, I'm not planning to combine this project with any other projects

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Amanda Jade Browne; email: amanda.browne@temple.edu
Ristia Khondaker; emial: ristia.khondaker@temple.edu
TA for both: Elmira Talebianaraki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We’ll make the basic game working with the ball, paddle, and blocks no matter what. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We’ll have some cool visuals, a couple of power-ups (like lasers or multi-ball), and the game will be more fun to play.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We’ll have a fully polished game with different levels, all the power-ups working, and smooth animations that make it a fun challenge.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next, we’ll look into making the power-ups and lasers work in Pygame, plus figuring out how to animate the background and objects. We’ll also need to look into making the ball’s movement and game levels more fun and challenging. One person will work on the game mechanics (paddle and ball), another will focus on the power-ups and lasers, and the third will handle the visuals and effects.
