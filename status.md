Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We created a breakout game featuring a background, music, a ball, power-ups, lasers, blocks, and hearts for the player. The player starts with three hearts and can earn additional ones by catching them with the paddle after breaking blocks.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We planned to add multiple levels to the game, but we havenâ€™t implemented them yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We encountered issues while trying to add an end game screen for when the player loses, along with a restart button.
